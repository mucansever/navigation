I have done this project as the final assignment of [BBM204 Software Laborotary II](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~bbm202/) course in Hacettepe University. Objective of this assignment was to practice the implementations of several data structures and algorithms such as quad-trees, ternary search trees and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm through a real-world like use case. I built the web server that drives the API to which requests from the user interface is being sent to, for the mapping of real-world map data which is freely available from the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) project.

You can test the project by running `MapServer.java` file in `src/main/java`, then opening `localhost:4567` from a browser.
